# Workout App

This is a project that tracks the distance that someone covers when swimming,running and cycling. 
Using the navigator.geolocation API we are able to retrieve the user's current location and save
it in the state.The API allows us to get the user's latitude and longitude ,so next we can
calculate the distance.When we click the 'Start Activity' button it retrieves our location 
and calculates the distance between the current location and the location where we started 
the activity.

## Tools
